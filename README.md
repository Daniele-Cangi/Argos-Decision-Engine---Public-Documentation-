## About ARGOS Decision Engine

ARGOS is not a simple “signal bot” — it is a **decision intelligence framework** designed for live monitoring, analysis, and action in crypto markets.

ARGOS is a **real-time decision-support system** for professional and semi-professional traders.  
It is not just a “signal bot”, but a **fusion engine** that explains its reasoning, tracks performance, and delivers a professional dashboard for market monitoring.

## 🚀 Key Differentiators

### 1. Explainable Signals
ARGOS outputs are not limited to **BUY/SELL/WAIT**.  
Each decision includes:
- **Tier** (1–3) for importance
- **Confidence** score
- **Consensus agreement/disagreement**
- **Gate reason** (e.g. volatility high, cooldown active)
- **Reson overlay** (probabilistic alpha layer with p_move, p_up, alpha_z)

This gives traders **clarity and justification**, not just blind signals.

### 2. Fusion Decision Engine
ARGOS combines:
- **Technical analytics** (RSI, %B, z-score, p_move)
- **Consensus logic** (multi-signal fusion, adaptive weights)
- **Noise policies** (entropy, flip-rate, volatility floors, cooldowns)
- **Reson overlay** (extra-alpha probabilistic driver layer)

The result is a **decision-support framework** designed to reduce false positives and deliver more consistent signals.

### 3. Professional Dashboard
- **Main board:** assets, price, signal, confidence, tier, “why” explanation  
- **Sparklines:** mini-charts per asset for quick visual anchoring  
- **Performance view:** win-rate by tier, hit/miss ratios, outcomes  
- **Events timeline:** track recent transitions with context  
- **Drill-down modal:** inspect technical, Reson, and fusion JSON details per asset  

Clean, clear, and usable by **traders who need to act fast but also understand why**.

### 4. Performance Tracking
- SQLite logging of signals and outcomes  
- Statistics: hit rate, average duration, win rate per tier/source  
- Evaluation over 30-day rolling windows

## 📊 Positioning vs. Other Frameworks
- **Not** just another trading bot.  
- Unlike *Freqtrade* or *Jesse*, ARGOS is **focused on decision support & explainability**, not on large-scale backtesting or automated order execution.  
- Unlike *Hummingbot*, ARGOS does not aim for 50+ exchange connectors — instead, it aims to be the **decision “brain”** that could even be paired with other execution frameworks.  
- **Unique proposition:** transparency, gating policies, noise control, and Reson overlay — features rarely seen in open-source trading software.

## 🔧 TECH

It fuses multiple layers into a single system:
- **Technical Analytics** — market structure, momentum, volatility regimes, probability-of-move metrics.
- **Consensus Logic** — multi-signal fusion with gating policies, noise control, and signal cooldown.
- **Reson Overlay** — advanced probabilistic layer providing additional alpha signals and scenario drivers.
- **Decision Engine** — combines all inputs into actionable stances (WAIT, ADVICE, BIG, WHALE).
- **Alerts & Logging** — configurable Telegram notifications, SQLite-based analytics, full event history.
- **Professional Dashboard** — modern web interface with live charts, confidence metrics, and decision intelligence panels.

ARGOS is built for **continuous monitoring**, providing not only entry/exit signals but also a **systemic view**: how confident the model is, whether consensus supports the stance, and how volatility/noise policies shape decisions.

### Why ARGOS?
Most trading bots output binary buy/sell suggestions. ARGOS is designed as a **fusion engine**: it produces graded advice, contextual reasoning (tiers, consensus, gating reasons), and performance tracking over time. This makes it closer to a **real decision-support system** than a simple alert generator.

### Key Features
- 🔍 Real-time monitoring for multiple assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA by default).  
- ⚡ Configurable delay, consensus mode, alpha mode.  
- 📊 Live dashboard with interactive charts and metrics.  
- 🔔 Telegram integration with policy-based alerts.  
- 🧠 Fusion of technical indicators and probabilistic overlay (Reson).  
- 📈 Performance tracking via SQLite (hit rate, outcomes, live open signals).  
- 🛡️ Noise policies and gating mechanisms to reduce false signals.  

ARGOS is designed for **research, evaluation, and private intelligence workflows**.  
Production or commercial deployment requires a separate license agreement.
