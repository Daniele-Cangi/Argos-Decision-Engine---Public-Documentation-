## About ARGOS Decision Engine

ARGOS is not a simple “signal bot” — it is a **decision intelligence framework** designed for live monitoring, analysis, and action in crypto markets.  

It fuses multiple layers into a single system:
- **Technical Analytics** — market structure, momentum, volatility regimes, probability-of-move metrics.
- **Consensus Logic** — multi-signal fusion with gating policies, noise control, and signal cooldown.
- **Reson Overlay** — advanced probabilistic layer providing additional alpha signals and scenario drivers.
- **Decision Engine** — combines all inputs into actionable stances (WAIT, ADVICE, BIG, WHALE).
- **Alerts & Logging** — configurable Telegram notifications, SQLite-based analytics, full event history.
- **Professional Dashboard** — modern web interface with live charts, confidence metrics, and decision intelligence panels.

ARGOS is built for **continuous monitoring**, providing not only entry/exit signals but also a **systemic view**: how confident the model is, whether consensus supports the stance, and how volatility/noise policies shape decisions.

### Why ARGOS?
Most trading bots output binary buy/sell suggestions. ARGOS is designed as a **fusion engine**: it produces graded advice, contextual reasoning (tiers, consensus, gating reasons), and performance tracking over time. This makes it closer to a **real decision-support system** than a simple alert generator.

### Key Features
- 🔍 Real-time monitoring for multiple assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA by default).  
- ⚡ Configurable delay, consensus mode, alpha mode.  
- 📊 Live dashboard with interactive charts and metrics.  
- 🔔 Telegram integration with policy-based alerts.  
- 🧠 Fusion of technical indicators and probabilistic overlay (Reson).  
- 📈 Performance tracking via SQLite (hit rate, outcomes, live open signals).  
- 🛡️ Noise policies and gating mechanisms to reduce false signals.  

ARGOS is designed for **research, evaluation, and private intelligence workflows**.  
Production or commercial deployment requires a separate license agreement.
